# PolyClash: A Go-like game on snub dodecahedron 

## Introduction

像数学真理，围棋是宇宙里一种永恒的游戏。类似的，扭棱十二面体也是一种永恒的几何体，它是最接近球体的阿基米德多面体。我们将这两者结合，创造了一种新的游戏：球面围棋。

Like mathematical truth, Go is an eternal game in the universe. Similarly, the snub dodecahedron is also an eternal geometric shape, which is the Archimedean polyhedron with the most sphericity.
We combine these two to create a new game: PolyClash.

扭棱十二面体有 60 个顶点，150 条边，92 个面，点、线、面个数的和是 302，这使得球面围棋的复杂性可以和围棋相当。如果考虑到点、线、面连通关系的多变，这个游戏的复杂性还会更高。

The snub dodecahedron has 60 vertices, 150 edges, and 92 faces. The sum of the number of points, lines, and faces is 302, which makes the complexity of PolyClash comparable to Go. If we consider the complex connectivity of points, lines, and faces, the complexity of this game will be even higher.

我们能否创建出一个尽量简单的规则集合，同时还使得游戏也非常有趣？从而使得这个游戏也能成为一个永恒的游戏。这就是我们的目标。

Can we create a set of rules that are as simple as possible while making this game very interesting? So that this game is also an eternal game. This is our goal.
