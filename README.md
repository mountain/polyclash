# PolyClash: A Go-like game on sphere by using snub dodecahedron

## Introduction

像数学真理，围棋是宇宙里一种永恒的游戏。类似的，扭棱十二面体也是一种永恒的几何体，它是最接近球体的阿基米德多面体。我们将这两者结合，创造了一种新的游戏：球面围棋。

Like mathematical truth, Go is an eternal game in the universe. Similarly, the snub dodecahedron is also an eternal geometric shape, which is the Archimedean polyhedron with the most sphericity.
We combine these two to create a new game: PolyClash.

我们能否创建出一个尽量简单的规则集合，同时游戏还非常有趣？从而使得它也能成为一个永恒的游戏。这就是我们的目标。

Can we create a set of rules that are as simple as possible while making this game very interesting? So that this game is also an eternal game. This is our goal.
