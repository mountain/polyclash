## Getting Started

If you're new to PolyClash, we recommend starting with the [Overview](01_overview.md) to get a high-level understanding of the project. Then, follow the [Installation Guide](02_installation.md) to set up PolyClash on your system. Once installed, you can learn the [Game Rules](03_game_rules.md) to start playing.

## For Developers

If you're a developer interested in understanding or contributing to PolyClash, the [Architecture](04_architecture.md) document provides a comprehensive overview of the system design. You can then dive deeper into the specific implementation details:

- [Client Implementation](05_client_implementation.md) for the GUI and game logic
- [Server Implementation](06_server_implementation.md) for the network server
- [AI Implementation](07_ai_implementation.md) for the AI opponent

## For System Administrators

If you're setting up a PolyClash server for network play, the [Network Play](08_network_play.md) and [Deployment Guide](09_deployment.md) documents provide detailed instructions for configuring and maintaining a production server.
