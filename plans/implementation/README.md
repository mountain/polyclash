# PolyClash Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for the various improvement phases outlined in the PolyClash roadmap. These plans provide specific code examples, commands, and step-by-step instructions for implementing the improvements.

## Available Implementation Plans

1. [**Test Structure Reorganization**](test_structure_reorganization.md): Detailed plan for reorganizing the test structure as part of Phase 1.1 (Enhanced Testing Framework)

## Planned Implementation Documents

The following implementation plans will be created as the project progresses:

2. **Core Game Logic Tests**: Implementation plan for expanding test coverage of the core game logic
3. **AI Component Tests**: Implementation plan for testing the AI components
4. **Network Component Tests**: Implementation plan for testing the network components
5. **UI Component Tests**: Implementation plan for testing the UI components
6. **Integration Tests**: Implementation plan for testing component interactions
7. **Functional Tests**: Implementation plan for testing complete workflows
8. **Performance Tests**: Implementation plan for testing performance
9. **CI/CD Setup**: Implementation plan for setting up continuous integration and deployment
10. **Code Refactoring**: Implementation plan for refactoring the codebase
11. **MCTS Implementation**: Implementation plan for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm
12. **Position Evaluation Heuristics**: Implementation plan for improving position evaluation
13. **Opening Book**: Implementation plan for creating an opening book
14. **Endgame Solver**: Implementation plan for implementing an endgame solver

## Implementation Approach

Each implementation plan follows this general structure:

1. **Goals**: The specific objectives of the implementation
2. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps for implementing the improvements
3. **Code Examples**: Specific code examples to guide the implementation
4. **Verification**: How to verify that the implementation is working correctly
5. **Next Steps**: What follows after completing the implementation

## Usage

To use these implementation plans:

1. Start with the first plan in the current phase
2. Follow the steps in order
3. Use the code examples as a guide, but adapt them to the specific needs of the project
4. Verify that each step is working correctly before moving on to the next
5. Once all steps are complete, move on to the next implementation plan

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these implementation plans:

1. Review the existing plans to understand the approach
2. Create a new plan following the same structure
3. Ensure that your plan is consistent with the overall roadmap
4. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing the Test Structure Reorganization plan, which is the first step in the Enhanced Testing Framework phase.
