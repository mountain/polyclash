# PolyClash Improvement Plans

This directory contains detailed plans for improving the PolyClash project. These plans are organized according to the roadmap and provide specific implementation details for each phase of the project's enhancement.

## Overview

PolyClash is a Go-like game played on a spherical board represented by a snub dodecahedron. The improvement plans aim to enhance various aspects of the project, including testing, code quality, user experience, AI capabilities, network play, and deployment.

## Plan Structure

Each plan document follows a consistent structure:
- **Goals**: The specific objectives of the phase
- **Current Status**: An assessment of the current implementation
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed steps for implementing the improvements
- **Testing Strategy**: How the improvements will be tested
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries and tools
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define success
- **Timeline**: Estimated duration for each task
- **Next Steps**: What follows after completing the phase

## Available Plans

1. [**Roadmap**](roadmap.md): The overall improvement roadmap with all phases
2. [**Phase 1: Testing Enhancement**](phase1_testing.md): Improving test coverage and quality
3. [**Phase 3: AI Enhancement**](phase3_ai.md): Implementing advanced AI algorithms

## Planned Documents

The following documents will be created as the project progresses:

4. **Phase 1.2: Code Refactoring**: Improving code structure and quality
5. **Phase 1.3: Technical Debt Reduction**: Updating dependencies and improving practices
6. **Phase 1.4: Documentation Overhaul**: Enhancing project documentation
7. **Phase 1.5: Development Environment**: Setting up consistent development environments
8. **Phase 2: User Experience Enhancement**: Improving the user interface and experience
9. **Phase 4: Network Play Enhancement**: Enhancing multiplayer functionality
10. **Phase 5: Deployment and Scaling**: Improving deployment and scaling capabilities
11. **Phase 6: Expansion and Innovation**: Adding new features and platforms

## Implementation Approach

The implementation of these plans will follow this general approach:

1. **Planning**: Detailed planning of tasks, dependencies, and milestones
2. **Development**: Implementation of planned features and improvements
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of new functionality
4. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
5. **Documentation**: Updating documentation to reflect changes
6. **Release**: Releasing the changes to users

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:
- GitHub Issues for individual tasks
- GitHub Projects for phase management
- Milestones for tracking phase completion
- Pull Requests for code review and integration
